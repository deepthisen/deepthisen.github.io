## Market and Regulatory Study for 5G Deployment

As a pro-bono consultant at the TAMU Graduate Consulting Club, our team works with a client to study the market for 5G deployment within the state of Texas. Our research throws light on the various regulatory hurdles that impede quick and effective deployment of 5G networks, despite recent favorable rulings on the part of the FCC. A good percent of these regulations are effective at the local/city level, which makes it close to impossible for 5G carriers and engineering services firms to expand into multiple markets (cities) with ease.

Our team is looking to streamline this process and to provide recommendations to our client for easy market entry.
